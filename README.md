PyScrape - Your automated fanart management
=====

PyScrape is an automatic fanart downloader and much more adapted for XBMC. You can download fanart and meta information for movies and TV Shows.  
PyScrape comes without any GUI (Graphical User Interface). It is planned to have a web interface, where you can handle configuration and fanart.

This project is currently released as an **alpha**, this means there can be bugs. Feel free to use the issues section on GitHub to report bugs and request features.

## Features
PyScrape **can** do a lot for you. Here a list of features

 - scrape Movies, TV Shows / Seasons / Episodes, ~~Music~~
 - download a lot of different fanart types (banner, backdrop, poster, landscape, logo, much more ...)
 - download information and create a .nfo file (ratings, actors, plot, summary, set, much more ...)
 - service that scans your media, once it's set up you don't have to do anything but enjoy your media
 - delete unwanted audio tracks
 - delete existing files (incomplete nfo, etc)
 - optimize images
 - highly configurable settings. You can set up almost everything.

## Requirements
Since PyScrape does a lot for you, there are some external dependencies to use all features.

    sudo apt-get install python2.7 imagemagick mkvtoolnix ffmpeg libav-tools optipng jpegoptim python-pip
    sudo pip install lxml

When the binaries are not in your PATH, you have to fix it in the configuration.
